### Clean Architecture
1. Core: This is the innermost layer that contains the application's business logic, domain models, and interfaces for accessing external resources.
2. Infrastructure: This layer contains the implementation of the interfaces defined in the Core layer, such as data access and logging.
3. Application: This layer contains the application services that coordinate the interactions between the Core and Infrastructure layers.
4. Presentation: This layer contains the UI and any other presentation-related logic, such as user input handling.
