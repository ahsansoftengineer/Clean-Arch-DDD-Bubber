### gRPC
- .NET Core is a free, open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern, high-performance applications. One of the key features of .NET Core is its support for gRPC, an open-source framework for building high-performance, cross-platform RPC (Remote Procedure Call) APIs.
1. Using .NET Core and gRPC together, you can build high-performance, efficient APIs that can be used across a wide range of platforms and devices. Here are some of the key features and benefits of using .NET Core and gRPC:
2. Protocol Buffers: .NET Core includes support for Protocol Buffers, the language- and platform-neutral data serialization format used by gRPC. This makes it easy to define your API using Protocol Buffers, and generate client and server code in a variety of programming languages.
3. High performance: .NET Core's support for gRPC enables you to build APIs that are fast and efficient, thanks to the use of HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers.
4. Authentication and encryption: .NET Core includes built-in support for authentication and encryption, which makes it easy to secure your gRPC APIs using TLS and other authentication mechanisms.

### HTTP/2:
- HTTP/2 is the latest version of the HTTP protocol, which is the foundation of the World Wide Web. It was designed to address some of the performance issues that were inherent in HTTP/1.1, such as high latency and low throughput. HTTP/2 is a binary protocol that uses a multiplexed, asynchronous communication model to improve performance. It also includes features such as server push, header compression, and flow control, which further improve performance.

### Protocol Buffers:
- Protocol Buffers is a language- and platform-neutral data serialization format that was developed by Google. It's designed to be highly efficient and compact, which makes it ideal for use in high-performance APIs. Protocol Buffers defines a schema for your data, which can be used to generate code in a variety of programming languages. This makes it easy to write code that can serialize and deserialize data in a consistent and efficient way.

### Concepts
| Heading | Defination |
|:-------:|:---------- | 
| API Versioning | API versioning is an important consideration for any API that is intended to be used by multiple clients over a long period of time. By carefully managing changes to the API and providing backward compatibility, developers can ensure that their API remains usable and valuable for their clients. |
| API Caching | API caching is the process of storing the results of an API request so that they can be quickly retrieved for future requests, without the need to re-execute the original request. Caching can significantly improve the performance of an API by reducing the number of requests that need to be made to the server. |
| Client Side Caching | Caching Data from Database |
| Server Side Caching | Caching Data from Server and store in Browser Cache |
| JWT | A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header contains information about the type of token and the algorithm used to generate the signature. The payload contains the data being transmitted, such as the user's ID and permissions. The signature is used to verify that the token has not been tampered with and that it was generated by a trusted party. |
| Single Sign On | Single Sign-On (SSO) is a method of allowing users to authenticate with multiple applications or services using a single set of login credentials. With SSO, users only need to sign in once, and they can then access all of the authorized resources without having to provide login credentials again.|

#### SSO 
1. SSO can be implemented using various technologies and protocols, such as SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect. In a typical SSO implementation, a user logs in to an identity provider (IdP) using their username and password. The IdP then generates a token, such as a JWT, that can be used to authenticate the user to other applications or services.
2. When the user attempts to access a protected resource on an application or service, the application or service redirects the user to the IdP for authentication. The IdP then verifies the user's identity and generates a new token that is passed back to the application or service, which uses the token to authorize the user's access.

#### Application Resilince
- A resilient application is an application that is designed to remain highly available and responsive even when faced with unexpected events or disruptions. Resilience is achieved through a combination of strategies such as redundancy, fault tolerance, and graceful degradation.
1. Redundancy refers to the provision of duplicate hardware or software components to ensure that if one fails, the application can still continue to function. For example, a resilient application might have multiple servers running the same application, with load balancers routing traffic to healthy servers in the event of a failure.
2. Fault tolerance refers to the ability of an application to continue functioning despite the failure of individual components. This is achieved through mechanisms such as automated failover or self-healing processes that can detect and repair failures.
3. Graceful degradation refers to the ability of an application to continue functioning at a reduced capacity when faced with high loads or degraded performance. For example, a resilient application might prioritize critical functionality and disable non-essential features during periods of high traffic or reduced resources.

#### What is Polly?
- Polly is a resilience framework for .NET available as a .NET Standard Library so it can run on your web services, desktop apps, mobile apps and inside your containers—anywhere .NET can run.
1. To date, Polly has been downloaded over 265 million times, and it’s easy to see why. With only a few lines of code, Polly can retry failed requests, cache previous responses, protect your resources, prevent you from making requests to broken services, terminate requests that are taking too long and return a default value when all else fails. It’s also thread safe and works on sync and async calls. 
2. Now that you understand why people are gravitating toward Polly, let’s run through the main features and how you can use them.



#### What is Retry in Polly?
As the name suggests, the Retry policy lets you retry a failed request due to an exception or an unexpected or bad result returned from the called code. It doesn’t wait before retrying, so be careful. If the problem that caused the request to fail is not likely to resolve itself almost immediately, retrying might not help; it might even make matters worse. The Retry policy lets you define how many retries should occur before it gives up.
#### API Versioning 
- There are several approaches to API versioning, including:
1. URI Versioning: api/v1/users and api/v2/users.
2. Header Versioning: Accept-Version: v1 and Accept-Version: v2.
3. Query Parameter Versioning: api/users?version=1 and api/users?version=2. 
4. Media Type Versioning: application/vnd.company.user-v1+json and application/vnd.company.user-v2+json.

| Language Support | C++, C#, F#, Visual Basic
| Mono |  Mono is also an extension of the .NET framework, but this has been optimized by Xamarin, for Android, Windows, iOS, and macOS. The base library for .NET Core is CoreFX Class Library, and for Mono is Mono Class Library.
| CTS | All programming languages have their own data type, and these cannot be understood by other languages. But CTS enables the .NET framework to understand all data types.
| Kestrel | Kestrel is a cross-platform web server that is enabled by default in ASP.NET Core project templates. It supports- HTTPS, HTTP/2, opaque upgrade (to enable WebSockets), and Unix sockets. It is supported on all versions and platforms of .NET Core.
| CoreFX | CoreFx is the term used to refer to the foundational/ introductory class libraries for the .NET Core.CoreFX consists of collection types, class types, consoles, XML, and JSON for class library implementations. This results in platform-neutral code which can be used as a single portable assembly.
| Garbage Collection On Going Process | Low physical memory, Threshold, Rare Testing Situations
| MSIL | MSIL stands for Microsoft Intermediate Language. Whenever we compile .NET codes, it is first converted to MSIL code, which then CLR interprets. The MSIL code is hardware and operating system independent.
| SDK VS .Net Core | The major difference between .NET Core SDK and .NET Core Runtime is that the former is functional in the building/ development of applications, while the latter is a virtual machine responsible for the application execution and running.
| Core SDK | The set of tools and libraries used in the development process is referred to as SDK. They help developers in creating .NET Core libraries and applications.


19. What is the hosting environment?
- The hosting environment contains application-specific details such as application functions, where it is stored, services for app management, etc. A HostingEnvironment is created in the ApplicationDomain, before the ASP's creation. In other words, a hosting environment is responsible for application management and app-specific functions.
- This feature of .NET Core makes it possible for the developer to work with multiple environments, without creating any friction.

20. Give a brief about Garbage Collection
- Garbage collection is one of the most important features of high-level programming languages and frameworks. The feature is carried on by a garbage collector which automates the process of memory allocation and management.
- There are three generations in the memory heap- zero (for short-lived objects), one (for medium-lived objects), and two (long-lived objects). The collection of garbage then refers to the collection of all the objects in different generations, that are no longer in use. The collector frees memory space by collecting these objects thus functioning as an automatic memory manager.
- Garbage collection occurs in three situations- one when the physical memory is low, when the acceptable threshold is exceeded, or when the GC method is called on. The major benefits of this are that developers don't need to manually free up what memory space, or worry about efficient allocation of objects on the managed heap, and it ensures security/ safety by blocking one object from using the content of another object.

26. What is Explicit Compilation (Ahead of time)?
- Explicit compilation refers to the process of converting upper-level language into project code before interaction or project execution. This is why explicit compilation is also referred to as ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, as in, before interaction between the CPU and program.

27. Mention a few benefits of AOT
Some benefits of AOT are:
- It leads to a smaller application size (exclusive of the angular compiler)
- Component rendering becomes quicker
- The template parse errors are detected early at the build time
- The program is more secure since there is no need to dynamically evaluate templates

28. Explain Docker in .NET Core
- Docker is a service container that is used to develop and publish applications. Application developers can package their applications in docker containers which can then easily be managed with git and can be synchronized across machines. These containers are lightweight and include everything needed to run the respective application without dependencies.

29. What is the IGCToCLR interface?
- The IGCToCLR interface is used to communicate with the runtime environment. It passes an argument to the InitializeGarbageCollector function.

21. Mention the main architectural components of .NET Core
- There are 3 main architectural components:
- .NET Core Runtime- The main purpose is to ensure the smooth functioning of the app/ program by providing type safety, native interop services, assemblies, garbage collection, etc.
- Framework Libraries- These include base libraries with components like app composition types and other fundamental utilities.
- SDK compilers (Roslyn) and command line tools- These facilitate quick development of programs/ applications on .NET Core

43. What is the purpose of the IDisposable interface?
IDisposable interface is defined in the System namespace and it contains a single method- Dispose(). The purpose of this method is to release unmanaged resources from the application or class library. Some of these unmanaged resources might include database connections, fonts, streams, files, etc.

44. What is the difference between 'managed' and 'unmanaged' code?
The primary difference between the 'managed' and 'unmanaged' code is that for the former, the CLR in the .NET framework manages the code, while in the latter the operating system directly executes the code. Also, the 'managed' code adds a layer of security to the application not present in the case of 'unmanaged' code.

45. Is the 'debug' class the same as the 'trace' class?
They aren't the same thing. Debugging refers to the process of finding errors in a code. While tracing refers to the process of charting out the execution pathway of a code, or getting other execution information. The trace class is broader in comparison as it can be used for both releasing builds as well as debugging the code.

46. What is MEF in .NET Core?
MEF stands for Managed Extensibility Framework and it is a library used for developing lightweight extensible applications. With the MEF, developers can discover extensions and use them without the need for configuration. Many believe that MEF is no longer available in .NET Core, however, it has been ported to the .NET Core as the System.Composition.

47. What are UWP Apps in .Net Core?
UWP stands for Universal Windows Platform and it is one of the numerous ways of client application creation for Windows. The WinRT APIs used in these apps result in powerful UIs and advanced asynchronous features. The common features of these apps are that they are secure, use a common API, and can install and uninstall the apps without risking 'machine rot'.

48. What is MSBuild?
Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) is a VS and Microsoft open-source platform for building applications. It helps in the automation of the software creation process including code compilation, testing, packaging, documentation, and deployment.

49. What is CoreRT?
The CoreRTis the .NET Core toolset that is responsible for compilation to translation processes. It uses the ahead-of-compiler RyuJIT to compile CIL byte core to machine code.

50. Explain response caching
Response caching is when the .NET Core MVC's HTTP responses are pre-specified in cache-related headers. These headers describe how intermediate or client machines should cache responses to requests. This hence reduces the volume of requests the client or proxy machine makes to the web server.

35.  What's the difference between RyuJIT and Roslyn?
Roslyn is a .NET Core compiler that compiles VB or C# code to the intermediate language (IL). Whereas, RyuJIT as the name suggests is a Just-In-Time compiler that works the other way around i.e. compiles the IL to native code.

22. What is meant by Razor Pages?
- Razor Pages is a comparatively newer and more simplified web app development/ programming model. The Razor Pages follow a file-based routing approach thus simplifying the "Model-View-Controller" architectural model of ASP.NET. The code and the HTML are both in a single file which eliminates the need for separate view models, controllers, action methods, etc.
