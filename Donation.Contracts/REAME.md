## Contract 

### Purpose of this Layer
- The contract layer is a layer that is sometimes used in Clean Architecture to define the interface that other layers should use to interact with the domain layer. It serves as a bridge between the domain layer and the rest of the application, providing a clear and consistent interface for the other layers to use.

- Note that the contract layer is not a requirement for Clean Architecture, and some implementations may choose to skip this layer, instead defining the interfaces directly in the domain layer. The important thing is to provide a clear separation between the domain layer and the other layers, regardless of whether a contract layer is used or not.

### Depends on
- For Now it is not also depends on Other Layer just like Domain Layer
